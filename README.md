A detailed list of steps that the student should follow, in narrative form, or combined code and narrative form.

Avoid providing direct answers in the steps, but do hint at the answer and provide empty code or comments for the students to fill in.

These steps should be more prescriptive at the start, and become less prescriptive as the student progresses through the workshop towards more the more advanced challenges.

Leave a challenge or two at the end with zero hints or guidance to see if the students can go beyond the workshop, and achieve something advanced on their own. Keep these challenges optional, and keep their difficulty within the confines of a competent student's abilities.
